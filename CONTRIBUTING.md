1. **Fork the Repository**  
   Create a fork of the repository to work on your changes independently.

2. **Create a Branch**  
   After forking, create a new branch for your feature or bug fix. This keeps your changes isolated from the main codebase.

3. **Make Changes**  
   Modify the unminified `src/rgaa-unfold.js` file (avoid editing the minified version directly). Ensure your changes work correctly by testing them.

4. **Follow Coding Conventions**  
   Please adhere to the existing coding conventions and style guide. Tools like **ESLint** are recommended to enforce consistent formatting.

5. **Test Your Changes**  
   Add or update tests to ensure your changes are functioning correctly and do not break existing functionality.

6. **Submit a Pull Request**  
   Once you are satisfied with your changes, submit a pull request (PR) to the main repository. Make sure to provide a clear description of the changes and any relevant issue numbers (e.g., "Fixes #123").

**Note**: Always work with the unminified version. The minified version is automatically generated during the build process.
